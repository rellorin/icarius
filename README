This is a CPP of a Program Assignment I completed. The class was GUI Programming with C++. My assignment was to create a program that would read Tools from an input file and display each tool's 

respective Product ID number
the tool name
a wholesale price
a markup %
quantity on hand 
retail price
value

I then gave the user an option to Add a tool to the beginning of the list, the middle of the list, or the end of the list. I also gave the user an option to delete a tool, or to print the inventory list.

I received an A on this assignment.
